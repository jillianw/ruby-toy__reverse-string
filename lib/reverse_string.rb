def reverse_characters(str)
  Hi Sumeet -- It's taking me FORevER to come up with these solutions so I just wanted to run my ideas past you to make sure I'm on the right track here. I think for both of the reverse (without using .reverse) problems, what needs to happen is a count of all of the characters in the string (or in the 2nd problem, converting to an array and counting the elements) using .length, then a one-at-a-time recall of each character/element backwards from the highest number. Is that sensible or am I barking up the wrong tree? If I'm correct, I don't need any specific help right now, I guess, but I may come back for additional assistance with the def/end coding. I feel like this is the first (or almost the first?) time I'm seeing "def..." and I may get stuck.
